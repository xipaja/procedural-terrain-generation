# procedural-terrain-generation

2D procedural terrain generation with the ability to adjust settings such as shape, color, and step size.

Squares or Hexagons - dropdown to choose if user wants the shapes to be squares or hexagons, and update algorithm accordingly to keep the shapes all connecting

Constrain Steps - constrain the random walk to within the viewport

Simulate Terrain - the shapes in the viewport will use colors such as brown, green, black, and white to simulate actual ground terrain. The colors change according to how often the random walk algorithm "steps" in one particular location, so the more times it steps in that location, the "higher" the elevation is, and the color will change accordingly.

Use Stroke - outline shapes in random walk
